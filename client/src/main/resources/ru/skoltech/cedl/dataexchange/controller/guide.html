<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>Once a customer has expressed his need to perform a concurrent design study, the preparation start with 1) collecting
    and documenting mission requirements, 2) identifying study constraints (budget, technology, confidentiality), 3)
    allocation of resources (people and facility time). The decision on which experts to involve is related to an
    approximate decomposition of the system and allocation of system functions to subsystems. At the end of the
    preparation (or start of the design study) a first joint meeting of the full design team is held together with
    representatives of the customer. The purpose of the meeting is to clarify the mission requirements and the role of
    each study participant.</p>

<h3>Systems Decomposition</h3>
<p>Based on the high-level functions the system has to fulfill, subsystems are identified and assigned to discipline
    experts present in the team. The structure of the system is encoded and stored in a system model.</p>

<h3>Connecting Subsystem Models</h3>
<p>After each subsystem has defined it’s input and output parameters, the discipline expert together with the team lead
    identify the source for each input. When starting with new models from scratch, this is a non-trivial task. It
    happens that for certain parameters, no other subsystem is yet providing that parameter as an output, and it must be
    decided which discipline shall produce and own it. For some inputs no other source can be identified, and the value
    can be determined freely by the discipline expert. It also happens that more than one subsystem claims to produce a
    certain output, and it must be decided which discipline shall produce and own it and the other disciplines take it
    as an input. In this step the subsystem model interfaces are refined in order to be able to interconnect them.</p>

<h3>Design Iterations</h3>
<p>The core of the design study are the concurrent design iterations. The goal of each iteration is to consolidate the
    design by making sure all input parameters take values which are correspondent to the mission requirements or to the
    output values produced by other subsystems. Since dependency relationships of subsystems are transitive and can form
    cycles, the design of subsystems potentially needs to re-iterated. The process of a single design iteration is
    described in the next section. Throughout the design study an arbitrary number of design iterations can occur, and
    they operate on a storage which keeps the state of the system model.</p>

<h3>Compile Study Report</h3>
<p>In conclusion of a Phase A design study one or more resulting system designs, which were evaluated to satisfy the
    mission requirements need to be documented and characterized according to common or mission specific performance
    measures (e.g. mass, cost, risk, schedule). For the continuation of the project, in case of approval of the results
    of the design study, the system requirements contained in the documentation will serve as starting point for the
    Phase B.</p>


<h2>Iteration Perspective</h2>
<img src="design-iteration.png" width="160" alt="Iteration Perspective"/>
<p>From the system model the dependencies among disciplines can be derived and represented as a design structure matrix
    (DSM). To this DSM a clustering algorithms determines an optimal sequence for updating one
    subsystem after the other.
    Based on this schedule one discipline is taken at a time and the responsible expert is asked to update his subsystem
    model. The internals of this action are described in a separate procedure in the next section. After that, depending
    on
    whether the subsystem’s output parameter values have changed, the schedule is updated or not. More precisely, if the
    outputs did change, then the disciplines which depend on them are put on the schedule again. In case the update of a
    discipline model led to changes of subsystem interfaces and thereby also dependencies, the schedule needs to be
    recalculated. Once there are no more disciplines on the schedule, it means the integrated system models has
    converged
    and represents a feasible point design and the iteration is finished.</p>

<h2>Discipline Perspective</h2>

<p>A discipline expert updating a subsystem model performs a simple sequence of activities. First the input values which
    are connected to other subsystems need to be updated. Depending on the kind of model, the designer either executes a
    calculation, runs a simulation, performs decisions based on prior knowledge or a combination of them.
    After that all the subsystem’s output parameters are updated. In parallel the expert checks the model for integrity,
    and in case additional input or output parameters are needed the interface is modified accordingly. Changes to the
    parameters are reflected in the stored system model.</p>
